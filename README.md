# The project

This project was inspired by a book that explains how to build a CPU and then a programmable computer (with memory...) from the most basic components. The book's name is "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles", and https://www.nand2tetris.org/ provides a brief overview of a possible angle for a project
<br>
I chose to implement my own version in a program named Logisim Evolution (https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) and once I completed this programmable computer (after designing the instructions, the CPU with its ALU, the program counter, the RAM...) I made it calculate the Fibonacci's sequence.


# A quick video demo

In the above video you can see multiple parts of the computer, with the ROM on the right containing the instructions for the CPU to calculate the Fibonacci's sequence in the RAM, you can also see two registers (A and D), and multiple connections, inputs and outputs of different parts. 
In the computer's memory you see the numbers from the Fibonacci appear !

You can read the book and run this file locally in Logisim Evolution (just open the .circ) for more details

In this video some other parts of the computer are shown.



# My conclusions

This project was really one of my all time favorite projects as I now finally completely and thoroughly understand how computers work and it's really rewarding and interesting to work through this.
