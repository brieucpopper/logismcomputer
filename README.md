This project was inspired by a book that explains how to build a CPU and then a programmable computer (with memory...) from the most basic components.

It was very exciting and I learned a lot along my way understanding and building this architecture and even implemented a program to calculate the Fibonacci sequence on this custom computer.

The program opens in Logisim Evolution and is based on the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"
