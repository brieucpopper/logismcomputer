# The project

This project was inspired by a book that explains how to build a CPU and then a programmable computer (with memory...) from the most basic components. The book's name is "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles", and https://www.nand2tetris.org/ provides a brief overview of a possible angle for a project
<br>
I chose to implement my own version in a program named Logisim Evolution (https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) and once I completed this programmable computer (after designing the instructions, the CPU with its ALU, the program counter, the RAM...) I made it calculate the Fibonacci's sequence.

# My conclusions

This project was really one of my all time favorite projects as you finally completely and thoroughly understand how computers work and it's really rewarding to work though this.
